    % Residuals are useful for detecting outlying y values and checking the linear regression assumptions with respect to the error term in the regression model. 
    % High-leverage observations have smaller residuals because they often shift the regression line or surface closer to them. 
    % You can also use residuals to detect some forms of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.
    % Errors in linear regression should have equal variance at all values of the predictor and should be normally distributed
    % equal variance: look at residual plot
    % normality: look at normal probability of residuals
    
    % histogram of residuals
    % Histogram of residuals using probability density function scaling. 
    % The area of each bar is the relative number of observations. 
    % The sum of the bar areas is equal to 1.
