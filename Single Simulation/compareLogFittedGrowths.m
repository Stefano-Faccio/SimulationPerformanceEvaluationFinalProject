% This function takes as input the following arguments:
% 1) TIME (0:1:ITERATIONS-1)
% 2) population per time unit corresponding to the continuous model
% 3) population per time unit corresponding to the discrete model
% 4) GROWTH_RATE (REPRODUCTION_PROBABILITY - DEATH_PROBABILITY)
% 5) CARRYING_CAPACITY
% 6) START_POPULATION
% 7) INFLECTION_TIME (CARRYING_CAPACITY/2)

% This function compares theoretical continuous and discrete growth models
% in order to check the constitutive difference between them,
% knowing that our stochastic simulation is of discrete logistic growth,
% using the parameter settings of our single simulation

% This function outputs the following plots in tiled layout:
% A) Big picture of the comparison between continuous (CM) and discrete (DM) logistic growth models
% B) Difference in population (\DeltaN) between DM and CM per time unit
