% Given that we performed 501 iterations, 500 of which throw 2
% probabilities from the uniform distribution per creature, 
% one for R and the other for cN, and
% that the maximum "stable" population should be around 5000 (L) in the "worst" case,
% we generated 500 (iterations) x 100 (stable population) x 2 (thrown
% probabilities) data points per simulation
% to assess the performance of the PRNG (on 100000 x 100 total data points) 
% on a global scale.
% No more could be done, due to time and computational costs.
% The ideal would have been to generate 500 x 5000 x 2 x 100(0) data points
% and check the correlation between each stream (corresponding to 1
% simulation, so 1 seed) with matlab corr()
% its uniform distribution, with matlab kstest() and chi2gof()
% and its randomness, with matlab runstest()

% Data points from different streams should not be correlated
% Spearman rank correlation coefficient
% Assumption: Non-parametric and does not assume a linear relationship but assumes a monotonic relationship.
% Use Case: Appropriate for both continuous and ordinal data. Particularly useful when the relationship is expected to be monotonic but not necessarily linear.
% Strength: Robust to outliers and non-linearity.
% Formula: Calculates the correlation based on the ranks of data points.
% Interpretation: Measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship, similar to Kendallâ€™s Tau.

%%
% Data points from different streams should not be correlated
% Pearson correlation coefficient
% Assumption: Assumes a linear relationship and that data is normally distributed.
% Use Case: Suitable for continuous data when you want to measure linear associations.
% Strength: Sensitive to linear relationships, good for capturing linear trends.
% Formula: Based on covariance and standard deviations of the original data.
% Interpretation: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship, 
% ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), 
% with 0 indicating no linear correlation.

% Run test for randomness (runstest)
% returns a test decision for the null hypothesis that the values in the data vector x 
% come in random order, against the alternative that they do not. 
% The test is based on the number of runs of consecutive values above or below the mean of x. 
% The result is 1 if the test rejects the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, or 0 otherwise.
% We want to score as much zeros as possible.


% One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (kstest)
% returns a test decision for the null hypothesis that the data in vector x 
% comes from a uniform distribution, against the alternative that it does
% not come from such a distribution.
% The result is 1 if the test rejects the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, or 0 otherwise.
% We want to score as much zeros as possible.


% Chi-square goodness-of-fit test (chi2gof)
% returns a test decision for the null hypothesis that the data in vector x 
% comes from a uniform distribution with a mean and variance estimated from x, 
% using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. 
% The alternative hypothesis is that the data does not come from such a distribution. 
% The result is 1 if the test rejects the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, and 0 otherwise.
% We want to score as much zeros as possible.
